# Stunt Lounge

The website was designed to be an interactive speaker. The idea of the design was created throught a thought process which stated; speakers used to 
be interactive objects that needed physical inetraction in order to change setting. This means, buttons (pause/start, next/previous, choose a song, etc.) 
However, nowadays, speakers are just objects that can be fully controlled by a device connected to it. This means there is no longer any physical 
interaction with speakers other than the on/off switch. Building something that is able to fully function through the physical touch is something I enjoy 
doing, as I see meaning in it. This is why I wanted to make my own User Interface (UI). I wanted to show that a user doesn't need to gain knowledge from 
a website. I wanted to show that a website could simply be for enjoyment and entertainment. At current times, we all live at 1000KPH, and sometimes it is 
okay just to sit back, relax, and mess around with something with no real end goal. This point in time, where everyone is to stay at home, and do nothing 
all day is a great time so create a website that allows people to relax and have fun. 

In order to come up with this idea, two things were combined, my love for music and minimalistic designs. I spend a lot of time listening to music as it is very 
important to me, as well as when I was younger I always enjoyed interactive websites that are made to satisfy the user with visuals and interaction. 
This project/website could be used for someone who just wants a different and unique speaker to play their music, or for someone to play around and enjoy.

## UX
 
This website is something to satisfy a users needs (in a simplistic way). I wanted to capture that speaker interactivity with this website, which is now lost in
the real life. There is no real point and goal that you get out of the use of this website. Thus, what it does give, is a simplistic outlook and idea which can be used 
at anyone's own liking. This website is a music player with a an interactive UI design and approach.



Re-Write this and add user stories like this ---------------




As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.


## Features


 
### Existing Features

- CRUD functionality 

- Create - The user has the ability to create and add new data into the database via the "Add Video" button. This then sends the information
that the user put into the form and creates a new file within the database with all the information about this video. Then the user is redirected back to the home 
screen where the info they filled in is displayed on the screen. 

- Read - The user has the ability to search for a file through the "Search by brand" seaction. This organized all the videos and creates a new page with only 
videos of the brand selected.

- Update - The user has the ablilty to update data from the database via the pen icon on each of the videos. Furthermore once at the "update video"
area, the specific data that was clicked is pulled from the database and put on display on the form to help the user more.

- Delete - The user can also delete information from the database by clicking on the trashcan icon next to each induvidual box.


### Features Left to Implement

- 

- Auto Url - I really wanted the user to paste any URL into the form and for to code to change this into a /enbeded/ link everytime. This is because 
currently the user has to manualy add the last 11 didgets from the url to allow the website to work. In the future i will study RegEx more to get an 
understanding to be able to inplement this feature. 

## Technologies Used

## Testing

I tested my website on multiple different screen sizes to make sure it all fits well together. However I stuck more to the larger computer screen size.
This is because most people just use an apps on their phones for their music.
